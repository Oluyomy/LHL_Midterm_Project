# Midterm-Project

## Project/Goals
COVID-19 created an unprecendented volatile labour market. The goal of the project is to explore the trend in job dataset from World Bank Data and produce insights about the current job market that is valuable for recruitment and selection strategies. The understaning in the job market will assist with resource allocation to help the labour market recover from the effect of the pandemic. 

## Process
We will work in an iterative process by building stats model from smaller series of data 
### Step 1: 
### Step 2:
### Step 3:
### Step 4:
### Step 5:

## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
1. Expand the model by using all the variables from the dataset.
2. Create a deployment to help predict the data
