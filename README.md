# Midterm-Project

## Project/Goals
COVID-19 created an unprecendented volatile labour market. The goal of the project is to explore the trend in job dataset from World Bank Data and produce insights about the current job market that is valuable for recruitment and selection strategies. The understaning in the job market will assist with resource allocation to help the labour market recover from the effect of the pandemic. 
- Project questions:

## Process
We will work in an iterative process by building stats model from smaller series of data 
### Step 1: Obtaining data
### Step 2: Loading and understanding the dataset.
### Step 3: Data pre-processing.
### Step 4:Data visualization.
### Step 5:Building a regression model.
### step 6:Model evaluation.
### step 7:Model prediction.
## Results
(Fill in which Option you chose, either 1 or 2. List the dataset you selected for the project if you selected Option 2. Also, discuss the visualizations you created, and why. For Option 2, also identify what your data question was, and how you went through the prompts.)

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
1. Expand the model by using all the variables from the dataset to expand the stats model and perform supervised learning to create a machine learning model that can help assess the current job market and the economy.
2. Create a deployment to help predict the job market condition.
3. Possible question to answer: Are we really heading toward a recession? The current dataset obtain from World Bank Data only information up to 2016. World Bank Data has "World Development Indicator" dataset which contained the job dataset as a subcategories with up-to-date information. Extracting more information and create a stats model to help analysis of the 2008 recession to the current job market and economic condition.
